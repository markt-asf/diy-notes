# Aqualisa Quartz Digital Shower with Diverter

Over a period of ~10 years I have so far had to replace the following across ~5 installs
- 2 smart valves (the larger black box that mixes the hot & cold water)
- 2 main controllers (the chrome unit located in the shower)
- 1 shower head
- 5 hoses for the hand-held shower

I have yet to see an issue with the diverter unit (the smaller black box).

I have yet to see an issue with the remote control (single button located outside of the shower).

| Symptom(s) | Solution |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Power trips out, water leak in smart valve | Replace smart valve |
| Shower starts, water flows for a couple of seconds and then stops. Won't start again without powercycle but issue continues. Clicking sound from diverter unit. | Replace main controller in shower |
