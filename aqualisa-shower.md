# Aqualisa Quartz Digital Shower with Diverter

Over a period of ~10 years I have so far had to replace the following across ~5 installs:
- 2 smart valves (the larger black box that mixes the hot & cold water);
- 2 main controllers (the chrome unit located in the shower);
- 1 shower head;
- 5 hoses for the hand-held shower.

I have yet to see an issue with the diverter unit (the smaller black box).

I have yet to see an issue with the remote control (single chrome button located outside of the shower).

| Symptom(s) | Solution |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Water leaks from smart valve input (usually after disconnection and reconnection). | Make sure filters and o-rings are seated correctly. If leaks persist, add a 20mm x 2mm nitrile o-ring next to the standard o-ring with the additional o-ring on the input side. |
| Power trips out, water leak in smart valve. | Replace smart valve. |
| Shower starts, water flows for a couple of seconds and then stops. Won't start again without powercycle but issue continues. Clicking sound from diverter unit. | Replace main controller in shower. |
